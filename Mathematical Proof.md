Comparing **structural global interpretability** (Surrogate Interpretable Graph + MILP) with **feature attribution explainability** (Tree SHAP), especially under the condition of **exponential feature growth and large random forests**.

---

### **Problem Setup**

Let:
- \( f \) = number of features
- \( T \) = number of trees
- \( d \) = max depth of trees
- \( L \approx 2^d \) = number of leaves per tree
- \( R \) = number of rules = \( O(T \cdot L) \)
- \( N \) = number of data instances

We assume:
- \( f \to \infty \) (feature explosion)
- \( T \to \infty \) (dense forest)
- You seek **compressed, human-interpretable summaries**.

## ‚úÖ **Advantages of SIG + MILP over Tree SHAP**

### 1. **Rule Compression and Structural Generalization**

Tree SHAP scales with:
\[
\text{Time}_{\text{TreeSHAP}} = O(N \cdot T \cdot L^2)
\]
Each instance gets its own SHAP value vector. When \( T \) and \( L \) grow, this becomes impractical:
- Too many trees \( \Rightarrow \) too many paths to compute SHAP.
- Too many features \( \Rightarrow \) expensive coalitional game computation per feature.

---

### **SIG + MILP** Scales with:

- **Rule extraction:** \( R = O(T \cdot 2^d) \) (but only once)
- **Surrogate Graph Creation:**  
  \[
  O(R \cdot f^2) \text{ (features in rules interact)}
  \]
- **MILP Compression (one-time):**  
  \[
  O(2^R) \text{ worst-case but approximate MILP optimizers are practical for small } R
  \]

If **feature usage is sparse**, most rules use a **small subset** \( k \ll f \), and:

\[
\text{Practical Time}_{\text{SIG+MILP}} \approx O(R \cdot k^2)
\]

Once rules are compressed, **SIG is independent of dataset size \( N \)**.

## üß† **Mathematical Advantage When \( f \to \infty \):**

Let‚Äôs define:
- Average number of features per rule: \( k \ll f \)
- Number of unique rules (after MILP): \( R' \ll R \)

Then:
\[
\text{SIG Time} = O(R' \cdot k^2)
\]
\[
\text{Tree SHAP Time} = O(N \cdot T \cdot L^2)
\]

Assume \( L = 2^d \), so:
\[
\text{Tree SHAP Time} = O(N \cdot T \cdot 4^d)
\]

Even for fixed \( d \), when \( T \) grows, Tree SHAP grows linearly with \( T \), while SIG+MILP **extracts once**, compresses to \( R' \), and reuses the result.

---

## üîê **Formal Asymptotic Advantage**

If:
- Rule reuse across subtrees is high
- Rule redundancy is compressible
- Feature usage per rule is sparse \( k \ll f \)

Then:
\[
\lim_{f \to \infty} \frac{\text{SIG+MILP}}{\text{Tree SHAP}} = \lim_{f \to \infty} \frac{R' \cdot k^2}{N \cdot T \cdot L^2} \to 0
\]
if \( k = o(f) \) and \( R' = o(T \cdot L) \)

|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Time vs feature size  | Sublinear if rules are sparse and compressible         | Linear to exponential (via coalitions) |
| Time vs dataset size  | Constant (after rule extraction)                       | Linear                                 |
| Interpretability      | Global, reusable across instances                      | Local, per-instance                    |
| Memory use            | Efficient with rule merging                            | Expensive with large \( T \) and \( f \) |

## üìå **Conclusion**

**SIG + MILP is more efficient and interpretable in the high-feature, high-tree regime** *if rule structure is compressible* ‚Äî something Random Forests often allow due to redundancy across trees.
